### Step 1: Download Terraform

> By command line:
1. Open your command prompt.
2. Use curl to download Terraform. Replace VERSION with the desired version number (e.g., 1.1.4):
      
      ```
      curl -o terraform.zip https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/VERSION/terraform_VERSION_windows_amd64.zip
      ```

3. Use tar to extract the ZIP file:

      ```
      tar -xvf terraform.zip
      ```

> By GUI:
1. Go to the [Terraform download page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).
2. Download the appropriate package for your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

### Step 2: Install Terraform

#### For Windows:

1. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice (e.g., `C:\terraform`).

2. Add the directory to your system's PATH:
  
      > By command line: <br/> `Assuming you have moved terraform.exe to C:\terraform, you can add this directory to the PATH using the following command`
      
      ```
      setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\terraform"
      ```

      > By GUI:
      - Open the Start menu and search for `Environment Variables`.
      - Click on `Edit the system environment variables`
      
          <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/495b8e1a-ca79-4103-b743-ed35ad190bec" />
      
      - In the System Properties window, click on `Environment Variables`.
      
           <img width="299" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5560100-5d3b-4461-a80d-eb1c1c2ede99" />
      
      - Under `System variables`, find the `Path` variable and click `Edit`.
      - Click `New` and add the path to the directory where you extracted Terraform (e.g., `C:\terraform`).
      - Click `OK` to close all windows.

#### For macOS:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Move the Terraform binary to a directory included in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):
   ```sh
   sudo mv ~/Downloads/terraform /usr/local/bin/
   ```
3. Ensure the directory is in your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file:
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
   ```
4. Reload your profile:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bash_profile  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

#### For Linux:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Move the Terraform binary to a directory included in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):
   ```sh
   sudo mv ~/Downloads/terraform /usr/local/bin/
   ```
3. Ensure the directory is in your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` file:
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
   ```
4. Reload your profile:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.profile
   ```

### Step 3: Verify the Installation
1. Open a new terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to verify the installation. You should see the installed version of Terraform.

   ```sh
   terraform -version
   ```

### Step 4: Initialize Terraform

Now you can run the `terraform init` command in your project directory:

```sh
terraform init
```
